# CSC Account

- A CSC account identifies you as a CSC user
- With the accout, you can join projects and access resources
- Check out the [tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/credentials.html) and the [documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/)
- Remember to keep your account alive by setting the password once a year
- Never share your account or send the password to anyone

# CSC Project

- CSC Projects are used for managing access to CSC services and resources
- Each project has its own disk quotas and billing unit quota
- Every project has a project manager and members
    - [Prerequisites and responsibilities of a project manager](https://www.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager)
- Every CSC user also has a _personal_ project which is only for technical purposes
    - The personal project is not meant for submitting jobs
    - All usage (e.g., batch jobs) needs to be done with CSC Projects (aka computing projects)
    - [FAQ on how to find info on your projects](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-find-information-about-projects/)

# Project lifetime and management

- The manager [invites members](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project/) to the project
- The project lifetime has to be [extended yearly](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-manage-your-project/) if the project still continues
- After the project is closed, the data will be cleaned
    - Members will be alerted by emails (see [Section 6.3. of General Terms of Use](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use))
-  If your project processes personal data or sensitive data, see [personal data announcement](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data/)
    - More information in [CSC's data policy](https://www.csc.fi/en/data-policy)

# Billing units

- CPU time and storing files consume "Billing units" (BU)
- BUs are tied to CSC projects (not personal) and can be applied via [my.csc.fi](https://my.csc.fi)
   - Academic usage has been paid for by the Ministry of Education and Culture and is thus free of charge
      - [Read more on free-of-charge use cases](https://research.csc.fi/pricing)
   - All members of a project can [apply for billing units](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units/)
   - Remember to [acknowledge CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-cite-csc/) in your publications and mention these in your BU application
- You can estimate [the usage with the billing unit calculator](https://research.csc.fi/pricing)
