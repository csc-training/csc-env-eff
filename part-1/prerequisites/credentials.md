## Project

ðŸ’¬ To use CSC supercomputers every account has to be a member of a project. Access to a supercomputer (service) and computing time are tied to projects.

ðŸ’¡ The default project called "Personal group of N.N." is not meant for submitting jobs

1. Join a project
    - via invitation link (ask the Project Manager to invite you)
    - or if you are [eligible to act as a Project Manager](https://research.csc.fi/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager) then go ahead and create a project

## Add services to your project

ðŸ’¡ The Project Manager [must have applied for the services](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/#project-manager) for the project first. Here, you accept the _Terms of Use_ and activate them.

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi)
2. Click My Projects and select a project
3. In the bottom right corner you see the services section
4. Select Puhti, (Mahti) and Allas, approve the terms and conditions and click Add service
