# Basic Linux commands

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è To begin make sure you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) that is a member of a project which [has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).

> ‚òùüèª You should also have already [logged in to Puhti with SSH](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html) or via the Puhti web interface (and opened a login node shell).

## Navigating folders

1. Now that you have logged in to Puhti, check which folder you are in by typing `pwd` and hitting `Enter`:

```bash
pwd
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
2. Check if there are any files:

```bash
ls
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 2"}
3. Make a directory and see if it appears:

```bash
mkdir YourNameTestFolder    # replace YourName
ls
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Go to that folder.

```bash
cd YourNameTestFolder       # replace YourName
```

üí° Note: if you just type `cd` and the first letter of the folder name, then hit `tab` key, the terminal completes the name. Handy!

## Exploring files

1. Download a file into this new folder. Use the command `wget` for downloading from a URL:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/master/part-1/prerequisites/my-first-file.txt
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
2. Check what kind of file you got and what size it is using the `ls` command with some extra options:

```bash
ls -lth         # options are l for long format, t for sorting by time and h for convenient size units. Anything that starts with a hashtag is a comment and is not executed
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 2"}
3. Use the `less` command to check out what the file looks like:

```bash
less my-first-file.txt
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. To exit the `less` preview of the file, hit `q`.

üí° Tip: Instead of `less` you can use `cat` which prints the content of the file(s) straight into the command line. For long texts `less` is recommended.

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 4"}
5. Make a copy of this file:

```bash
cp my-first-file.txt YourName-first-file.txt    # replace YourName
ls -lth
less YourName-first-file.txt                    # replace YourName
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 5"}
6. Remove the file we originally downloaded (leave your own copy).

```bash
rm my-first-file.txt
ls
```

üí° Tip: If you don't want to have duplicate files you can use `mv` to 'move/rename' the file. Syntax is the same: `mv /path/to/source/oldname /path/to/destination/newname`.

## More information

- Learn [how to edit that file](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-file-editing.html) in the next tutorial!

üí° For more information of a given command line `command`: type `man command` or `command --help` where `command` is replaced with the one that you need help with.

üí° Tip: If you remember *a part of a command* that you have used recently you can search for it with the command `history | grep string`. This will show all your used commands that have included the string `string` (replace this with the pattern you are searching for).
