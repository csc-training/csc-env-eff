# Using Allas in batch jobs

## Preparations

üí¨ The `allas-conf` command opens an Allas connection that is valid for eight
hours.

- In case of interactive usage, this eight-hour limit is not problematic as
  `allas-conf` can be executed again to extend the validity of the connection.
- In case of batch jobs, the situation is different, as it may take more than
  eight hours before the job even starts!

1. To be able to use Allas in a batch job, load the Allas module and run
   `allas-conf` again with the `-k` option:

   ```bash
   module load allas
   allas-conf -k 
   ```

   - Here, the option `-k` indicates that the password will be stored in an
     environment variable `$OS_PASSWORD`. With this variable defined, you no
     longer need to input your password when you re-execute `allas-conf` with
     the `-k` option and the Allas project name.

   ‚òùüèª Note that if you mistype your password when using the `-k` option, you
   must use the command `unset OS_PASSWORD` before you can try again.

3. Refresh the connection with the command:

   ```bash
   allas-conf -k <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
   ```

   ‚òùüèª When `$OS_PASSWORD` is set, the `a-commands` (`a-put`, `a-get`, `a-list`,
   `a-delete`) automatically refresh the Allas connection when the commands are
   executed in a batch job.

4. Choose a file from Allas. The file should have text in it. You can use the
   one you created in
   [one of the earlier tutorials](../../part-1/allas/allas-usage.md),
   or then any other text file you have in Allas:

   ```bash
   a-list <project_number>_$USER  # replace <project_number> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, to match the bucket you created earlier
   ```

5. Create a new batch job script. First open a new text file with the command:

   ```bash
   nano allas_job.sh
   ```

6. **Option 1:** `a-commands`
   1. Copy the batch job script below to the text file you are editing:

      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      #SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job          # Name of the job visible in the queue
      #SBATCH --account=<project>              # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!
      #SBATCH --time=00:05:00                  # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition
      #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G                 # How much RAM is reserved for one processor
      #SBATCH --partition=test                 # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, ...
      #SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt     # Name of the output-file
      #SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt      # Name of the error-file
        
      bucketname=<project_number>_$USER        # Replace with your bucket name, e.g. 2001234_username
      filename=<filename>                      # Replace with your file name
        
      a-get $bucketname/$filename              # Bucket name / file name
      wc -l $filename > $filename.num_rows     # file name
      a-put -b $bucketname $filename.num_rows
      ```

   2. In the script, replace `<project_number>_$USER` to match your bucket name
   and `<filename>` to the name of the file you have in Allas. Remember to also
   define your billing project (`--account`).

7. **Option 2:** `rclone`  
   
   ‚òùüèª If you use `rclone` or `swift` instead of the `a-commands`, you need to
   add `source allas_conf` commands to your script.
   
   1. Copy the batch job script below to the text file you are editing:   

      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      #SBATCH --job-name=my_allas_job          # Name of the job visible in the queue.
      #SBATCH --account=<project>              # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!
      #SBATCH --time=00:05:00                  # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition. 
      #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G                 # How much RAM is reserved for one processor.
      #SBATCH --partition=test                 # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, $
      #SBATCH --output=allas_output_%j.txt     # Name of the output-file.
      #SBATCH --error=allas_errors_%j.txt      # Name of the error-file.
      
      bucketname=<project_number>_$USER        # Replace with your bucket name, e.g. 2001234_username
      filename=<filename>                      # Replace with your file name
      
      # Make sure the connection to Allas is open
      source /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME
      rclone copy allas:$bucketname/$filename ./
      
      wc -l $filename > $filename.num_rows
      
      # Make sure the connection to Allas is open
      source /appl/opt/csc-cli-utils/allas-cli-utils/allas_conf -f -k $OS_PROJECT_NAME
      rclone copy $filename.num_rows allas:$bucketname
      ```

   2. Replace `<project_number>_$USER` to match your bucket name and `<filename>`
   to the name of the file you have in Allas. Remember to also define your
   billing project (`--account`).
8. Submit the batch job with the command:

   ```bash
   sbatch allas_job.sh
   ```

9.  Monitor the progress of your batch job:

    ```bash
    squeue -u $USER
    a-list <project_number>_$USER    # replace <project_number> with your CSC project number, e.g. 2001234, to match your bucket
    ```
