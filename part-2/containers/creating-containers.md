# Creating Apptainer containers

💬 In this tutorial we will create an Apptainer container and install the same
software as we installed in the tutorial
["Installing a simple C code from source"](../installing/c.md). Feel free to
revisit that tutorial for more information on the installation commands.

💬 CSC supercomputers support the `fakeroot` feature of Apptainer, so it is
possible to build container images without root privileges. There are some
limitations, so it is possible to run into problems, especially when using
package managers. In these cases it is necessary to either use an alternative
installation method for the dependency, or build on a system where you do have
root privileges.

☝🏻 We will only cover Apptainer basics here. Detailed instructions can be
found in the official
[Apptainer documentation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html).

## Sandbox mode

💬 One way to create an Apptainer container is in the so-called sandbox mode.
Instead of an image file, we create a directory structure representing the file
system of the container.

💬 First, we'll create a basic container from a definition file. In order to
choose a suitable Linux distribution, you should check the documentation of the
software you wish to install. If the developers provide installation
instructions for a specific distribution, it is usually easiest to start with
that.

💭 In this case there is no specific reason to choose one distribution over
another, but from experience it is known that the software installs without
problems on Ubuntu, so we'll start with that.

1. Start from a very bare-bones definition file. Copy the following lines to a
   file called `hmmer.def`:

   ```text
   Bootstrap: docker
   From: ubuntu:24.04
   
   ```

2. By default, Apptainer uses the home directory for cached files. As the home
   directory is quite small and easily fills up, it is recommended to use some
   other directory. For example to use `$TMPDIR` (make sure it is defined) set:

   ```bash
   export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=$TMPDIR
   ```

3. You can clean the cache with command:

   ```bash
   apptainer cache clean
   ```

4. Using this definition file, build the container:

   ```bash
   apptainer build --fix-perms --fakeroot --sandbox hmmer hmmer.def
   ```

   💡 It is also possible to do this directly without a definition file:

   ```bash
   apptainer build --fix-perms --fakeroot --sandbox hmmer docker://ubuntu:24.04
   ```

5. Note that instead of an image file, we created a directory called `hmmer`. If
   you need to include some reference files etc., you can copy them to the
   correct subdirectory.

6. We can now open a shell in the container. We need the container file system
   to be writable, so we include the option `--writable`. We will also need to
   include `--fakeroot` option:

   ```bash
   apptainer shell --cleanenv --fakeroot --writable hmmer
   ```

7. The command prompt should now be `Apptainer>`.

   💡 Notice that unlike on CSC supercomputers, we are able to use package
   management tools (in this case `apt`). This will often make installing
   libraries and other dependencies easier. Also notice that it is not
   necessary to use `sudo` inside the container. HMMER is available as a
   package on Ubuntu, so we could install it directly:

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install -y hmmer
    ```
   Often the versions available through package mangers are not the latest,
   so installing from source files may be preferable.

   💡 The base container images are typically very bare-bones and do not
   contain any compilers, download tools etc., so those need to be installed.
   If there is a need to make the container as small as possible, we should
   only install the dependencies we need. Usually the size is not that
   critical, so we may opt for ease of use.
   
   💡 In this case we will install the application group `build-essential`
   that includes most of the components we need (C, C++, make), but also a lot
   of tools not needed in this example. We also install `wget` to download the
   source code.
   
   ```bash
   qpt update
   apt install -y build-essential
   apt install -y wget
   ```

8. We are now ready to install the `hmmer` software. Download and extract the
   distribution package:

   ```bash
   wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/hmmer.tar.gz
   tar xf hmmer.tar.gz
   cd hmmer-3.4
   ```

9. Run configure:

   ```bash
   ./configure
   ```

10. Check the output of `configure` and install any missing dependencies. In
    this case there should not be any. Finally, run `make`:

    ```bash
    make
    make install
    ```

   💡 Notice that in the container we can install to the default location (in this case /usr/local/bin), 
   so we don't need to specify `--prefix` like when installing on Puhti directly. We also don't need to 
   add anything to `$PATH`, as the installation location is already included in the default `$PATH` 
   

11. We can now test the application to see if it works:

    ```bash
    hmmsearch -h
    ```

12. If everything works we can clean up:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    rm -rf hmmer*
    ```

13. We can also add a `runscript`:

    ```bash
    echo 'exec /bin/bash "$@"' >> /apptainer
    ```

14. We can now exit the container:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

15. We can then build a production image from the sandbox:

    ```bash
    apptainer build --fakeroot hmmer.sif hmmer
    ```

16. We can now test it:

    ```bash
    apptainer exec hmmer.sif hmmscan -h
    ```

## Definition file

💬 The above method is fine if you intend the container to be only used by you
and your close collaborators. However, if you plan to distribute it wider, it's
best to write a definition file for it. That way the other users can see what
is in the container, and they can, if they so choose, easily rebuild the
production image.

💡 A definition file will also make it easier to modify and reuse the container
later. For example, software updates can often be done simply by modifying the
version number in the definition file and rebuilding the image.

1. To write the definition file, we can start from the original bare-bones file
and add various sections to it as required. The installation commands go into
the `%post` section:

   ```text
   %post
     apt update
     apt install -y build-essential
     apt install -y wget
     wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/hmmer.tar.gz
     tar xf hmmer.tar.gz
     cd hmmer-3.4
     ./configure
     make
     make install
   ```

2. If you need to set any environment variables, they go into the
   `%environment` section. If you need to include any files in the container,
   they go into `%files`. The `runscript` goes to `%runscript`.
3. 
There are also other sections available if needed. More information can be
   found in the [Definition Files chapter](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/definition_files.html)
   of the Apptainer documentation.

4. The final definition file would look like this:

   ```text
   Bootstrap: docker
   From: ubuntu:24.04
   
   %post
    apt update
    apt install -y build-essential
    apt install -y wget
    wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/hmmer.tar.gz
    tar xf hmmer.tar.gz
    cd hmmer-3.4
    ./configure
    make
    make install
   
  %environment
    export LC_ALL=C
   
  %runscript
    exec /bin/bash "$@"
   ```

5. You can now build the image:

   ```bash
   apptainer build --fakeroot hmmer.sif hmmer.def
   ```

6. In more complex cases, it often helpful to first build the image in the
   sandbox mode and make note of all the commands needed. You can then write a
   definition file to replicate the necessary steps.
