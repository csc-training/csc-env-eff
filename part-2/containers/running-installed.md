# Running containerized applications

üí¨ In this tutorial we will get familiar with the basic usage of containerized
software.

üí≠ Some software on CSC supercomputers have been installed as containers.

- Usually, we try to make the containers as transparent as possible using
  wrapper scripts. This way, there should be little to no change in usage from
  the users' perspective.

üí≠ Sometimes, however, this is impractical and there might be slight
differences compared to the standard usage as described in the documentation.

- Typically, this will also be the case for software you containerize yourself.
  You can, however, use [Tykky](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/containers/tykky/)
  to create wrapper scripts to facilitate use of containers.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Please see the software documentation in [Docs CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/)
for details and other considerations.

- To run these exercises on Puhti, use `sinteractive` or open a compute node
  shell in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi):

  ```bash
  sinteractive --account <project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
  ```

## Example: A "hidden" installation

1. An example of a container-based installation that has been "hidden" behind a
   wrapper script is R. Load `r-env` module and check the contents of `Rscript`
   command:

   ```bash
   module load r-env
   cat /appl/soft/math/r-env/432/Rscript
   ```

2. Observe that it is not the "real" `Rscript` command, but a wrapper script
   using `apptainer_wrapper exec`. Now, try running `Rscript`:

   ```bash
   Rscript --version
   ```

3. As you can see, `Rscript` works as expected, and in most cases you don't
   need to care about the fact that it is installed as a container.

   üí≠ You can find more details about using R in the Docs CSC page of the
   [`r-env` module](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/).

   üí° If you're unable to open an interactive session due to high load during the
   course, you can try this example in a login shell instead:

   ```bash
   module load cutadapt
   cutadapt -h
   ```
