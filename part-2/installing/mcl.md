# Installing a simple C code from source

üí¨ In this tutorial we will install the MCL Markov cluster algorithm program to
the [`/projappl` directory](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/disk/) of the user on
Puhti.

üí≠ This software is also available as an installation package (`.deb`, `.rpm`)
for various Linux distributions, but these can not be used on Puhti. Instead,
we install it from the source code.

‚òùüèª To follow the instructions, first set an environment variable pointing to
your project's `/projappl` directory:

```bash
export PROJAPPL=/projappl/<project>  # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
```

## Obtaining the source code

1. Create your own directory under `$PROJAPPL` (if not done already) and move
   there. Then, create and move to a new directory for the installation:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $PROJAPPL/$USER
   cd $PROJAPPL/$USER
   mkdir mcl
   cd mcl
   ```

### Downloading a distribution package

1. Download the distribution package:

   ```bash
   wget https://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz
   ```

   üí¨ In this case the installation package is a tar-archive file that has been
   compressed with `gzip` program.

2. Unpack the file with the command:

   ```bash
   tar -xvf mcl-latest.tar.gz
   ```

   üí¨ After unpacking, the `ls` command shows that a new directory called
   `mcl-14-137` has been created. This directory contains the actual
   installation files and documentation of the software.

### Alternative option: Get the software from GitHub

1. Clone source code from Github:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/mcl.git
   ```

   üí¨ After cloning, the `ls` command shows that a new directory called `mcl`
   has been created. This directory contains the actual installation files and
   documentation of the software.

## Preparing to install

1. Create a new directory called `version-14-137` under the `mcl` directory for
   the actual installation.

   ```bash
   mkdir version-14-137
   ```

2. Move to the `mcl-14-137` (or `mcl` if cloning from git) directory and study
   its contents:

   ```bash
   cd mcl-14-137
   ls
   ```

   üí¨ Installation packages often contain short installation instructions.
   Typically, this instructions file is called `INSTALL` or `README`.

3. Read the `INSTALL` file to learn how the installation should be done.

   ```bash
   less INSTALL
   ```

   üí° Move in the file opened with `less` with up and down arrows, and exit
   with `q`.

## Installation

üí¨ Many open-source software tools are installed using the so-called
"configure-make" procedure following three steps:

1. Configuring a so-called `Makefile` with a `./configure` script.
2. Running the `make` command that compiles the source code according to the
   instructions in `Makefile`.
3. Installing the compiled executables with the command `make install`.

üí≠ Normally, installation packages assume that the user has the required
permissions to install the software to the locations where Linux binaries and
libraries normally get installed.

- However, at CSC this is not the case. You can install software only to your
  own (or your project's) disk areas.
- Often you can use the option `--prefix=<path>` to tell to the `configure`
  script where the program should be installed (replacing `<path>` with the
  actual path).

üí≠ The `./configure` script checks that all compilers and libraries that the
software needs are available.

- It is not uncommon that `./configure` reports about missing libraries or
  incorrect compilation options.
- In such cases, you should check if the missing library or program could be
  made available by loading a suitable module.

üóØ The CSC computing environment has several compiler versions and HPC
libraries available.

- In some cases you may, for example, need to use a specific C compiler or
  Python version in order to install a software. Read the compilation
  instructions carefully and try different versions if needed.
- If the compilation still fails, don't hesitate to ask for help from the
  [CSC Service Desk](https://docs.csc.fi/support/contact/).

1. To compile `mcl`, load the GNU C compiler (`gcc`) version 9.4.0:

   ```bash
   module load gcc/9.4.0
   ```

2. In this case we wish to install the software under the `version-14-137`
   directory in your `$PROJAPPL` area. Thus, you need to specify the custom
   location for the installation using the `--prefix` option:

   ```bash
   ./configure --prefix=$PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137  # double check that the path is correct
   ```

3. Compile and install the software with the commands:

   ```bash
   make
   make install
   ```

   ‚òùüèª If you intend to compile software packages larger than the rather small MCL
   example used here, please use the fast local disk (`$TMPDIR`) to avoid
   stressing the parallel file system. Compiling complex applications typically
   cause a lot of I/O load.

4. If the `make` and `make install` commands don't give any error messages, you
   have successfully installed your own software!

   üí≠ Typically, the executables/binaries, i.e. the compiled programs that can
   be launched, are stored in a subdirectory called `bin`.

5. Check what binaries were installed with:

   ```bash
   ls $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin
   ```

## Running the software

üí¨ Although the software is now ready to be run, it is not automatically added
to your `$PATH`. This means that running:

```bash
mcl --help
```

will give an error message `bash: mcl: command not found`.

üí¨ You need to tell the computer where to find that command.

1. Try running the software by providing the full path to the binary, i.e.:

   ```bash
   $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin/mcl --help
   ```

2. Add the path of the MCL executables to your `$PATH` environment variable.
   This is done with the command:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl/version-14-137/bin:$PATH  # double check that this path matches your actual installation path
   ```

   ‚ÄºÔ∏è When running `export`, note that the variable we are defining (first
   `PATH`) should *not* have a dollar sign. Also, note that we include the
   current `$PATH` at the end (*with* a dollar sign).

   ‚òùüèª If we omit the current path, the normal shell commands will stop working!

3. Now you can launch the program you have installed from anywhere without
   first going to the `bin` directory or specifying the full path:

   ```bash
   mcl --help
   ```

üí¨ Remember that the `PATH` variable must be set each time you log in to the
supercomputer before you can run the `mcl` command without providing the full
path.

‚òùüèª You need to run the correct `export PATH=...` command also in batch job
files before launching self-installed programs without the full path.

üí° If you want to make the addition automatically, add the `export PATH=...`
command to your `.bashrc` file in your `$HOME` directory.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Making changes to the `.bashrc` file may cause incompatibilities with
software installed by CSC.

üí≠ If you wish to revert your `.bashrc` file (and your environment in general)
back to default, you can use the
[csc-env command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).

üí° Note that loading modules installed by CSC will automatically modify your
`$PATH` as needed, so no exports are typically required if you only run
pre-installed applications.

## Cleaning up

- If the software you have installed works correctly, you can remove the
  installation package and temporary directories that were used during the
  compilation.
- In this case we can remove the `mcl-latest.tar.gz` package and the whole
  `mcl-14-137` directory:

   ```bash
   cd $PROJAPPL/$USER/mcl
   rm mcl-latest.tar.gz
   rm -r mcl-14-137
   ```
