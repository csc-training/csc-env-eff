# Installing binary applications

üí¨ In some cases software developers offer ready-made binary versions of their software.

- If the binary version runs, you don't need to compile the software yourself.

‚òùüèª It should be noted that ready binary versions are typically not optimized for CSC supercomputers.

- The performance difference will depend on the code and on how the application was compiled.
- Often the difference is just a few percent, but in some cases it can be more substantial.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Especially all MPI codes need to be compiled on the machine they will be run on to ensure correct operation.

## Make the installation in your own folder in the `/projappl` directory of your project

1. Move to the `/projappl` directory of your project:

```bash
cd /projappl/<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
2. If not done already, create your own folder under your project's `/projappl` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p $USER
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 2"}
3. Move to your folder:

```bash
cd $USER
```

## Example: Installing the GCTA software

üí¨ In this example we'll install the binary release of the GCTA software.

1. Go to the [GCTA download page](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Download).
2. Identify the Linux version.
    - If several Linux versions are offered, try to find one with "x86" in the name.
    - If versions are offered by Linux distribution, try first the versions made for CentOS or RedHat if present.
    - Sometimes you may have to try different versions to find one that works.
3. Here is the link for the Linux version (accessed 2022-12-16). Download the zip file by running:

```bash
wget https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/bin/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Unzip the file:

```bash
unzip gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 4"}
5. The software is now ready to use, but you will have to tell the computer where to find it.
6. Trying just the following will result in a `command not found` error because you are not accessing the right folder yet.

```bash
gcta64
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 6"}
7. Try instead:

```bash
gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64/gcta64
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 7"}
8. Or:

```bash
cd gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64
./gcta64
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 8"}
9. The result shows that the software runs.
    - The error message is just about missing arguments which is normal.

üí¨ Instead of providing the full path in the command line, you can also add the application to your `$PATH`.

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 9"}
10. Move to `./gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64` if not there yet.

11. Add the current working directory to `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 11"}
12.  You can now run the program from any directory simply with:

```bash
gcta64
```

## Some notes

üí° When adding paths to `$PATH`, always remember to append the current `$PATH`, otherwise some of your normal shell commands etc. will stop working.

‚òùüèª To add paths automatically, you can add the `export` command to your `$HOME/.bashrc` file. Instead of `$PWD`, use the full path:

```bash
export PATH=/projappl/<project>/$USER/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64:$PATH   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
```

‚ÄºÔ∏è If you make changes to your environment (e.g. edit `.bashrc`), it is possible that there will be conflicts with applications pre-installed by CSC.

üí≠ If you encounter problems after modifying your environment, it is possible to restore it to the default state permanently or temporarily using the [`csc-env` command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).
