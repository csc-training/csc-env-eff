# Installing binary applications

> This tutorial is done on **Puhti**, which requires that:
  - You have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/).
  - Your account belongs to a project [that has access to the Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).

üí¨ In some cases software developers offer ready-made binary versions of their
software.

- If the binary version runs, you don't need to compile the software yourself.

‚òùüèª It should be noted that ready binary versions are typically not optimized
for CSC supercomputers.

- The performance difference will depend on the code and on how the application
  was compiled.
- Often the difference is just a few percent, but in some cases it can be more
  substantial.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Especially all MPI codes need to be compiled on the machine they will be run
on to ensure correct operation.

## Make the installation in your own folder in the `/projappl` directory of your project

1. Move to the `/projappl` directory of your project:

   ```bash
   cd /projappl/<project>   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
   ```

2. If not done already, create your own folder under your project's `/projappl`
   directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $USER
   ```

3. Move to your folder:

   ```bash
   cd $USER
   ```

## Example: Installing the GCTA software

üí¨ In this example we'll install the binary release of the GCTA software.

1. Go to the [GCTA download page](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Download).
2. Identify the Linux version.
   - If several Linux versions are offered, try to find one with "x86" in the
     name.
   - If versions are offered by Linux distribution, try first the versions made
     for CentOS or RedHat if present.
   - Sometimes you may have to try different versions to find one that works.
3. Here is the link for the Linux version. Download the `.zip` file by running:

   ```bash
   wget https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/bin/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip
   ```

4. Unzip the file:

   ```bash
   unzip gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64.zip
   ```

5. The software is now ready to use, but you will have to tell the computer
   where to find it.
6. Trying just the following will result in a `command not found` error because
   you are not accessing the right folder yet.

   ```bash
   gcta64
   ```

7. Try instead:

   ```bash
   gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64/gcta64
   ```

8. Or:

   ```bash
   cd gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64
   ./gcta64
   ```

9. The result shows that the software runs.
   - The error message is just about missing arguments, which is normal.

üí° Instead of providing the full path in the command line, you can also add the
application to your `$PATH`.

10. Move to `./gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64` if not there yet.
11. Add the current working directory to `$PATH`:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
    ```

12. You can now run the program from any directory simply with:

    ```bash
    gcta64
    ```

## Some notes

üí° When adding paths to `$PATH`, always remember to *append* the current
`$PATH`, otherwise some of your normal shell commands etc. will stop working.

‚òùüèª To add paths automatically, you can add the `export` command to your
`$HOME/.bashrc` file. Instead of `$PWD`, use the full path:

```bash
export PATH=/projappl/<project>/$USER/gcta-1.94.1-linux-kernel-3-x86_64:$PATH   # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
```

‚ÄºÔ∏è If you make changes to your environment (e.g. edit `.bashrc`), it is possible
that there will be conflicts with applications pre-installed by CSC.

üí≠ If you encounter problems after modifying your environment, it is possible
to restore it to the default state permanently or temporarily using the
[`csc-env` command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/).
