# R on Puhti and package installations

üí¨ A pre-installed R environment is available on Puhti.

1.  To check available module versions, run:    

    ``` bash
    module spider r-env
    ```

2.  There are several ways to use R in `r-env` on Puhti:

    - Interactive jobs on a compute node, using either the R console or RStudio  
      üí° The easiest way to launch RStudio is to use the Puhti web interface at [www.puhti.csc.fi](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/)
    - Non-interactive batch jobs
    - Interactively on the login node, using the R console (**only** for moving data, checking package availability, installing packages)

    For example, to launch the R console in an interactive job, open a shell with `sinteractive` and then

    ``` bash
    module load r-env
    start-r
    ```

üí° See the [r-env documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/) for further instructions on different ways to launch R on Puhti.

üí¨ It is also possible to [install R packages yourself](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/#r-package-installations).

‚òùüèª However, check first if what you need is already available in `r-env`. The module contains more than 1300 R packages! The easiest way to check if a package is available is trying to load it with the command `library(packagename)`.

## How to install an R package on Puhti

- Note that your own package installations are:
  - project specific
  - R version specific
  - located in the `/projappl` directory of your project

1.  Create a folder for your R packages in `/projappl` (open a login node shell in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/) or log in to Puhti with SSH):

    ``` bash
    # First navigate to /projappl/<project>, then
    mkdir project_rpackages_<rversion>
    ```

2.  Start an R session (launch RStudio in the [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/) or launch the R console in an interactive shell session: start the job with `sinteractive` -\> `module load r-env` -\> `start-r`). In R, add the folder you created above to the list of directories where R will look for packages:

    ``` r
    .libPaths(c("/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>", .libPaths())) 
    ```

    Assign `libpath` to point to this directory (not strictly necessary but can make life easier):

    ``` r
    libpath <- .libPaths()[1]
    ```

3.  Install the package (again, defining `lib = libpath` to specify the installation location is not strictly necessary but recommended)

    ``` r
    install.packages("packagename", lib = libpath)
    ```

    For example, you can try installing a package called `beepr` with

    ``` r
    install.packages("beepr", lib = libpath)
    ```

    Finished! The R package is now ready to be loaded and used. Try loading `beepr` with `library(beepr)`.

üí° The package location is defined only for the current R session! R has to be reminded of the location at the start of every R session or script where you want to use the project-specific package by running this command again:

``` r
.libPaths(c("/projappl/<project>/project_rpackages_<rversion>", .libPaths())) 
```

üí° Instead of installing a missing package for your own project, you can ask for a module-wide installation for all users by contacting [CSC Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi)
