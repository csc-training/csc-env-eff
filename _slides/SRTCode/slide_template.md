:::info (speech)
If you want the voiceover to say something about the cover slide you should write it down here.

# 1st Slide title

- Text
- More text
- *About* Stuff
   -  Probably CSC computers

:::info (speech)
If you want the voiceover to say something about the first slide you should write it down here.
:::


# 2nd Slide title

- Much text and [links](https://docs.csc.fi/)
   - None of this should be in captions or voice over
- But under the slides there should be some room for text
   - There you can write the voiceover stuff and the captions

:::info (speech)
So this is the explanation part whih is read by the voiceover.
The sentences should be fairly short and on point.
The captions look better with short one-line sentences, but if you have longer you need to split them in the video editor.

# Difference between captions and voiceover texts

- Voiceover reads titles and the explanation
   - Titles begin with # but only if the line starts with #
- Captions take only the explanations
   - Explanations start with tag :::info (speech) and end with ::: 
     - Again only if the line starts with those
     - The tags could be anything but those look nice in HackMD

:::info (speech)
The script uses tags to distinguish between caption and voiceover content.
