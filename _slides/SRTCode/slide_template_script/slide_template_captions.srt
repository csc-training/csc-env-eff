00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.033
If you want the voiceover to say something about the cover slide you should write it down here.

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:11.067
If you want the voiceover to say something about the first slide you should write it down here.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.133
The sentences should be fairly short and on point.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:29.167
The captions look better with short one-line sentences, but if you have longer you need to split them in the video editor.

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:35.200
The script uses tags to distinguish between caption and voiceover content.
