1
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:28,583
There is a new web interface that can be used to access Puhti directly from a web browser.

2
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:34,366
Note that the web interface is still a beta-version which means there might be further changes.

3
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:38,683
Use you CSC username to log in.

4
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:43,883
From there you can access your files in Puhti and launch some applications.

5
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:48,083
More in-depth documentation is available in Docs CSC

6
00:00:54,216 --> 00:01:01,633
The usual way to log in to CSC supercomputers is using a secure shell (SSH). 

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,849
SSH can be opened in for example in the Command Line Interface. 

8
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:10,383
In Linux and Mac that is known as Terminal.

9
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:14,516
We recommend to get familiar with the basics of a Command Line Interface,

10
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,733
which is a little more spesific interface 

11
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:20,133
that lets you use the full power of a supercomputer.

12
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:27,250
We have documentation and an introductory tutorial on how to SSH to Puhti. 

13
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,233
The links are in the description.

14
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:35,349
Mac and Linux come with an SSH client in the Terminal by default. 

15
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,599
In Windows 10, there's something called the PowerShell. 

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,000
It can be used, but it might not be fully compatible with our set up. 

17
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:49,383
Therefore we recommend another software called MobaXTerm which is free to use.

18
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:54,099
Putty or CMDer can be used as well.

19
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,716
Installing these software may require admin privileges, 

20
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:01,566
so you might need your IT support to do this for you.

21
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:07,750
If you do plain SSH, by default it might not allow displaying remote graphics. 

22
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:13,066
On Linux or Mac you can just add a capital X or Y to your SSH command, 

23
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,066
and it will tunnel the remote graphics from Puhti. 

24
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,616
In Windows MobaXTerm has a way to do that, 

25
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,750
or then you would need to install some other tools. 

26
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:34,716
Sometimes you may edit files in your local computer and

27
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:38,400
want to copy the files to a supercomputer or vice versa.

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,866
You can use secure copy and RSync directly from the command line. 

29
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:50,599
The basic syntax is scp or RSync, then source path, then target path.

30
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:58,033
The path in another computer needs to include the domain and the username at that machine.

31
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,783
RSync is available in MobaXTerm which is one reason

32
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:08,316
we recommend MobaXTerm for Windows users. 

33
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:16,633
Sometimes a graphical user interface for transferring files is much more convenient.

34
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,166
For Windows FileZilla and WinSCP are good examples. 

35
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:24,916
Installing them might require admin privileges.

36
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:30,583
MobaXTerm also has a file transfer functionality. 

37
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:36,466
When downloading files they go by default to a home folder, which is in a weird place. 

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,599
The tip is to first choose this home directory from the Settings tab.

39
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:49,183
Also Puhti web interface can be used to move files between Puhti and a local computer.

40
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,533
SSH-keys are used for example in some RStudio or Jupyter Notebook workflows.

41
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:07,433
You don't need SSH-keys for logging in to CSC supercomputers, 

42
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,116
but they can make your workflows easier at some point. 

43
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,533
A tutorial covers the setup for SSH-keys.

44
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,383
The link is in the materials index page.

45
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:28,533
The default workflow for editing files is to open an editor on Puhti. 

46
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:34,683
With lot of files, for example when coding that is not so convenient.

47
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:40,016
For these purposes you can install a suitable editor like Visual Studio code

48
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:44,100
or configure Notepad++ so that they sync the files to Puhti. 

49
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,500
We have some detailed documentation in docs.csc.fi 

50
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,583
with instructions on how to set up such environment.

51
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:56,899
The tutorials about Accounts and Connecting continue from here.

52
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,616
They cover the basic use cases with easy-to-follow examples.

53
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,649
