1
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:28,583
There is a new web interface that can be used to access Puhti directly from a web browser.

2
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:34,366
Note that the web interface is still a beta-version which means there might be further changes.

3
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:38,683
Use you CSC username to log in.

4
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:43,883
From there you can access your files in Puhti and launch some applications.

5
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,700
More in-depth documentation is available in Docs CSC

6
00:00:54,216 --> 00:01:01,633
The usual way to log in to CSC supercomputers is using a secure shell (SSH). 

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,849
SSH can be opened in for example in the Command Line Interface. 

8
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:10,383
In Linux and Mac that is known as Terminal.

9
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:14,799
We recommend to get familiar with the basics of a Command Line Interface,

10
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,133
which is a little more spesific interface that lets you use the full power of a supercomputer.

11
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:27,250
We have documentation and an introductory tutorial on how to SSH to Puhti. 

12
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,233
The links are in the description.

13
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:35,349
Mac and Linux come with an SSH client in the Terminal by default. 

14
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,599
In Windows 10, there's something called the PowerShell. 

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,000
It can be used, but it might not be fully compatible with our set up. 

16
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:49,383
Therefore we recommend another software called MobaXTerm which is free to use.

17
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:54,099
Putty or CMDer can be used as well.

18
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,716
Installing these software may require admin privileges, 

19
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:01,566
so you might need your IT support to do this for you.

20
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:07,750
If you do plain SSH, by default it might not allow displaying remote graphics. 

21
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:13,233
On Linux or Mac you can just add a capital X or Y to your SSH command, 

22
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,633
and it will tunnel the remote graphics from Puhti. 

23
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:20,233
In Windows MobaXTerm has a way to do that, 

24
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,366
or then you would need to install some other tools. 

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,500
Sometimes you may edit files in your local computer and

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,550
want to copy the files to a supercomputer or vice versa.

27
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:43,650
You can use secure copy and RSync directly from the command line. 

28
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:54,300
The basic syntax is scp or RSync, then source path, then target path.

29
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:01,733
The path in another computer needs to include the domain and the username at that machine.

30
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:08,483
RSync is available in MobaXTerm which is one reason

31
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:12,016
we recommend MobaXTerm for Windows users. 

32
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:20,333
Sometimes a graphical user interface for transferring files is much more convenient.

33
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,866
For Windows FileZilla and WinSCP are good examples. 

34
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:28,616
Installing them might require admin privileges.

35
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:34,283
MobaXTerm also has a file transfer functionality. 

36
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:40,166
When downloading files they go by default to a home folder, which is in a weird place. 

37
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,300
The tip is to first choose this home directory from the Settings tab.

38
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:52,883
Also Puhti web interface can be used to move files between Puhti and a local computer.

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,233
SSH-keys are used for example in some RStudio or Jupyter Notebook workflows.

40
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:11,800
You don't need SSH-keys for logging in to CSC supercomputers, 

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,483
but they can make your workflows easier at some point. 

42
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:19,233
A tutorial covers the setup for SSH-keys.

43
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,083
The link is in the materials index page.

44
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:32,233
The default workflow for editing files is to open an editor on Puhti. 

45
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:38,383
With lot of files, for example when coding that is not so convenient.

46
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,716
For these purposes you can install a suitable editor like Visual Studio code

47
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,800
or configure Notepad++ so that they sync the files to Puhti. 

48
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,199
We have some detailed documentation in docs.csc.fi 

49
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,283
with instructions on how to set up such environment.

50
00:04:55,716 --> 00:05:00,600
The tutorials about Accounts and Connecting continue from here.

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,316
They cover the basic use cases with easy-to-follow examples.

52
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,350
