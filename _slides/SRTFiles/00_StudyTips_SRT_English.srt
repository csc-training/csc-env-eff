1
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:28,166
This is how the course material is organised.

2
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:36,483
The material involves slides, videos, hands-on tutorials and exercises.

3
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:44,600
The material often links to the documentation at docs.csc.fi.

4
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:49,716
These tips help you to navigate within the slides and other material.

5
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,799
This is the general procedure of solving problems.

6
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,433
First try looking at the docs. 

7
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,250
The pages are organised hierarchically.

8
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,250
There is also a FAQ-section that covers many topics.

9
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,299
You might try the search button in the docs 

10
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,966
or googling the keywords or the error message.

11
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:24,516
If you can't find the answer then send an email to servicedesk at csc.fi.

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,316
A descriptive title helps us direct the message to the right people.

13
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:32,533
Explain what you wanted to achieve and on which computer, 

14
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:36,549
what commands you gave and what error messages resulted.

15
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:42,783
There is a rather detailed help specifying how to compose a good support request.

16
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:45,400
It will help us to solve your issue faster 

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,683
and you will get more quickly to do the work.

18
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,966
Some applications come with a tutorial.

19
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,750
Doing those will be the fastest way forward.

20
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,766
There are also instructions or documentation for installed applications.

21
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:17,483
The documentation sometimes contains application spesific batch scripts.

22
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,633
If they are not available you may use the general batch script template.

23
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,816
You can try to run the application interactively.

24
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:33,566
Do not do this in the login node but instead use for example sinteractive.

25
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:37,650
It is a one easy way to see that things are running correctly.

26
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:52,316
You can also try to run the application in a test queue.

27
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:55,233
Usually the results come quickly.

28
00:02:56,133 --> 00:03:00,166
It helps you to tweak your batch script before longer runs.

29
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:04,966
It is not nice to wait in a long queue just to see that there is a typo in the script.

30
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,650
Always before you launch any big projects you should run a small trial

31
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,766
to make sure that the results are expected.

32
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,099
You may use the results to adjust the resource usage.

33
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:22,300
It benefits all users when the resources are used efficiently.

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,449
If your job fails you should first check for these issues.

35
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:42,466
Usually the job runs out of allocated time or memory.

36
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,183
If the job fails immediately there is usually a typo in the script.

37
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:13,816
The error files provide useful information on why the job failed.

38
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:22,300
Sometimes they may be difficult to interpret but sometimes there is a clear answer.

39
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,800
If you have difficulties to understand the error file 

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,816
you may just send us the error file and we will take a look at that.

41
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:50,583
You may also look at the FAQ on common Slurm issues.

42
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,716
When you have solved or discovered something

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,149
we recommend that you document it for yourself

44
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,583
so that you can easily rediscover it later.

45
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,883
Here is one way to do it.

46
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:12,566
You can use cat command to save text in a file for example in your home folder.

47
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:19,133
After entering the first line you can copy paste commands or other text like a description.

48
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:23,250
Press control and C when you are finished typing.

49
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,199
You can use grep to look for content in that file.

50
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,583
Try the links in the slides, tutorials and video descriptions 

51
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,933
to discover relevant documentation or more content.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,100
We wish you happy learning!
