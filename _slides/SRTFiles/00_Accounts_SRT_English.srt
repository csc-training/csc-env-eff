1
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:27,283
A CSC account is needed for using CSC supercomputers. 

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,383
To get started, please find the links to tutorial and the documentation 

3
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,216
that guide you with the account creation.

4
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,266
Keep the account valid by renewing the passphrase annually. 

5
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,383
You will get a reminder by email. 

6
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:50,366
Never share your account or the passphrase with anyone!

7
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,516
The resources at CSC are managed with projects.

8
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:04,633
Each project has a quota for disk space and cpu time.

9
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,216
Each project has a manager and members.

10
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:14,500
If you're working on the same topic then it makes sense to be in the same project.

11
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:19,450
Here's a link to the qualifications of a project manager.

12
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,083
Check here if you are eligible to act as a project manager.

13
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:32,650
In addition to CSC-projects there's something called a personal project.

14
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,849
That is a technical way to make sure

15
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,266
that nobody else accesses your home folder in Puhti. 

16
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:42,066
You are not supposed to use the personal project for anything. 

17
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:46,266
It is not meant for running batch jobs!

18
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,799
Please find more information on you projects in the documentation.

19
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:57,700
You can use this command to see what projects you have. 

20
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,450
It works on the command line on Puhti and Mahti.

21
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,383
The project manager can invite new members to the project.

22
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,900
These projects are intended not to last indefinitely 

23
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,199
and their lifetime has to be extended yearly.

24
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:25,483
If the project is no longer active the project will be closed and the data will be deleted.

25
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:30,250
There's a 90 day grace period during which you will get notified by email.

26
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,616
In Puhti you're not supposed to process any personal or sensitive data.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,066
If your project needs to handle such data, please check out the documentation 

28
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,050
on how to manage the data in the MyCSC-service.

29
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:53,483
Running jobs and virtual machines or storing files 

30
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:56,866
consume something called Billing units.

31
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:03,316
These Billing units are a property of the CSC-projects.

32
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,133
More Billing units can be applied in MyCSC 

33
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,666
where you can manage your CSC-projects. 

34
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:17,116
Academic usage has already been paid for by the ministry of education and culture.

35
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:23,183
The free-of-charge use cases have been defined here in detail.

36
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:28,533
Remember to acknowledge CSC in your publications and 

37
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,583
list your publications also in your Billing unit application.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,616
You can estimate the Billing unit consumption with the Billing unit calculator.

39
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:42,633
This was the projects and accounts review.

40
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:47,400
The tutorials about accounts and projects continue from here. 

41
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,933
They cover the basics with easy-to-follow examples. 

42
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,383
