# CSC Account

- CSC Account identifies you as a CSC user
- With the accout you can join projects and access resources
- Check out the [tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/credentials.html) and the [documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/)
- Remember to keep your account alive by setting the password once a year
- Never share your account or send the password to anyone

A CSC account is needed for using CSC supercomputers. 
To get started, please find the links to tutorial and the documentation that guide you with the account creation.
Keep the account valid by renewing the passphrase annually.

# CSC Project

- CSC Projects are used for managing access to CSC services and resources
- Each project has its own disk quotas and billing unit quota
- Every project has a project manager and members
    - [Prerequisites and responsibilities of a project manager](https://www.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager)
- Every CSC user also has a _personal_ project which is only for technical purposes
    - The personal project is not meant for submitting jobs
    - All usage (e.g. batch jobs) needs to be done with CSC Projects (aka computing projects)
    - [FAQ on how to find info your projects](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-find-information-about-projects/)

:::info (speech)
The resources at CSC are managed with projects.
Each project has a quota for disk space and cpu time.
Each project has a manager and members.
If you're working on the same topic, then it makes sense to be in the same project.
Here's a link to the qualifications of a project manager.
:::

Switch to # [Prerequisites and responsibilities of a project manager](https://www.csc.fi/en/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager)

:::info (speech)
Check here if you are eligible to act as a project manager.
:::

Switch to # CSC Project

:::info (speech)
In addition to CSC-projects, there's something called a personal project.
That is just a technical way to make sure, that nobody else accesses your home folder in Puhti. 
You are not supposed to use the personal project for anything. 
It is not meant for running batch jobs!
Please find more information on you projects in the documentation.
:::

Switch to # [FAQ on how to find info your projects](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-find-information-about-projects/)

:::info (speech)
You can use command: csc-projects to see what projects you have. 
It works on the command line on Puhti and Mahti.

# Project lifetime and management

- The manager [invites members](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project/) to the project
- The project lifetime has to be [extended yearly](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-manage-your-project/) if the project still continues
- After the project is closed the data will be cleaned
    - Members will be alerted by emails (see [Chapter 10. of General Terms of Use](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use))
-  If your project processes personal data or sensitive data, see [personal data announcement](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data/)
    - More information in [CSC's data policy](https://www.csc.fi/en/data-policy)

:::info (speech)
The project manager can invite new members to the project.
These projects are intended not to last indefinitely, and their lifetime has to be extended yearly.
If the project is no longer active, the project will be closed and the data will be deleted.
There's a 90 day grace period, during which you will get notified by email.

In Puhti you're not supposed to process any personal or sensitive data.
If your project needs to handle such data, please check out the documentation on how to manage the data.

# Billing units

- CPU time and storing files consume "Billing units" (BU)
- BUs are tied to CSC projects (not personal) and can be applied via [my.csc.fi](https://my.csc.fi)
   - Academic usage has been paid for by the Ministry of Education and Culture, and for them money won't be charged
      - [Read more of free-of-charge use cases](https://research.csc.fi/pricing)
   - All members can [apply for billing units](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units/)
   - Remember to [acknowledge CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-cite-csc/) in your publications and mention these in your BU application
- You can estimate [usage with the billing calculator](https://research.csc.fi/pricing) 

:::info (speech)
Running jobs and virtual machines or storing files consume something called Billing units.
These Billing units are a property of the CSC-projects.
More Billing units can be applied in MyCSC where you can manage your CSC-projects. 
Academic usage has already been paid for by the ministry of education and culture.
The free-of-charge use cases have been defined in detail in research.csc.fi/pricing.
Remember to acknowledge CSC in your publications, and list your publications also in your Billing unit application.
You can estimate the Billing unit consumption with the Billing unit calculator.

This was the projects and accounts review.
The tutorials about accounts and projects continue from here. 
They cover the basics with easy-to-follow examples.
