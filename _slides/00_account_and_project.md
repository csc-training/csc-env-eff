# CSC account

- A CSC account identifies you as a CSC user
- With the account, you can join projects and access resources
- Check out the [tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/credentials.html) and the [documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/)
- The password of your CSC user account is valid for one year at a time
    - You will recieve a notification when it is about to expire
- Never share your account or send the password to anyone

# CSC project

- CSC projects are used for managing access to CSC services and resources
- Each project has its own disk quotas and billing unit quotas
- Every project has a project manager and members
    - [Prerequisites and responsibilities of a project manager](https://research.csc.fi/prerequisites-for-a-project-manager)
- Every CSC user also has a _personal_ project which is only for technical purposes
    - The personal project is not meant for submitting jobs
    - All usage (e.g. batch jobs) needs to be done with CSC projects (a.k.a. computing projects)
    - [FAQ on how to find info about your projects](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-find-information-about-projects/)

# [Different project types](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/)

- [Academic project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#academic)
  - Can be created only by members of Finnish higher education institutions and state research institutes (valid for one year, can be extended)
- [Course project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#course)
  - Designed for delivering a course _once_ (fixed resources, valid for max. 6 months, cannot be extended)
- [Student project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#student)
  - Designed to support students' course and thesis work (fixed resources, valid for max. 6 months, cannot be extended)

Note: A separate [LUMI project](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#how-to-create-finnish-lumi-projects) is required to access LUMI. [Commercial projects](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#commercial) are only available via <servicedesk@csc.fi>

# Project lifetime and management

- The manager [invites members](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-members-to-project/) to the project
- The project lifetime has to be [extended yearly](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-manage-your-project/) if the project still continues
- After the project is closed, the data will be cleaned
    - Members will be alerted by emails (see [Section 6.3. of General Terms of Use](https://research.csc.fi/terms-of-use/#63))
-  If your project processes personal data or sensitive data, see [personal data announcement](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data/)
    - More information in [CSC's data policy](https://www.csc.fi/en/data-policy)

# Billing Units

- Using most CSC services consumes [Billing Units (BU)](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/billing/). There are four different BU types:
  - CPU & GPU Billing Units, Storage Billing Units and Cloud Billing Units
- BUs are tied to CSC projects (not personal) and can be applied via [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi)
   - Academic usage is free of charge
      - [Read more about free-of-charge use cases](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use)
      - [Read more about our services for commercial use](https://research.csc.fi/commercial-use/)
   - All members of a project can [apply for billing units](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-apply-for-billing-units/)
   - Remember to [acknowledge CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/how-to-cite-csc/) in your publications and mention these in your BU application
- You can estimate [usage with the billing unit calculator](https://research.csc.fi/resources/#buc)
