# R

ðŸ’¬ A pre-installed R environment is available on Puhti.

1. To check available module versions, run:

```bash
module spider r-env
```

ðŸ’¬ It is also possible to [install your own R packages](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/#r-package-installations).

- However, check first if what you need is already available in `r-env`. The module contains more than 1300 R packages!

ðŸ’¡ See the [r-env documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/) for further instructions.
