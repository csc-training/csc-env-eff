# Backing up files to Allas from Puhti

## Preparations (if not done already)

1. Login to `puhti.csc.fi`
2. In Puhti, check your environment with the command:

```bash
csc-workspaces
```

{:start="3"}
3. Switch to the `/scratch` directory of your project

```bash
cd /scratch/<project>    # replace <project> with your CSC project, e.g. project_2001234
```

{:start="4"}
4. Create your own subdirectory named as your username (tip! your username is automatically stored in the environment variable `$USER`):

```bash
mkdir -p $USER
cd $USER
```

## Connecting to Allas

1. Open a connection to Allas wih these commands:

```bash
module load allas
allas-conf 
```

ðŸ’¡ It might take a while to run `module load allas`.

{:start="2"}
2. If you have several projects with the Allas service available, select the one where you want to perform the backup.
3. Check how the `allas-backup` tool works with the command:

```bash
allas-backup -h
```

{:start="4"}
4. Create a backup snapshot with the command:

```bash
allas-backup <filename>    # replace <filename> with the name of the file that you want to backup
```

{:start="5"}
5. Check what snapshots the backup contains:

```bash
allas-backup list
allas-backup list | grep $USER
```

- Make note of the snapshot `ID` in the first column!

{:start="6"}
6. Check what files your backup contains:

```bash
allas-backup files <snapshot_id>      # replace the <snapshot_id>
```

{:start="7"}
7. Restore the files from your backup to Puhti:

```bash
allas-backup restore <snapshot_id>      # replace the <snapshot_id>
```

{:start="8"}
8. If you want to delete your backup, use command:

```bash
allas-backup delete <snapshot_id>      # replace the <snapshot_id>
```
