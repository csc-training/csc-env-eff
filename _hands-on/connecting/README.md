# Connecting to CSC Supercomputers

## Tutorials
* [CSC account and project](credentials.md)
* [Login Puhti with ssh](ssh-puhti.md)
* [Create SSH-keys](ssh-keys.md)
* [Run R studio/Jupyter Notebook on Puhti via ssh-tunnel and browser](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/rstudio-or-jupyter-notebooks/) This requires ssh-keys (see above) and is documented here for legacy reasons. This way is superseded by the Open OnDemand based Puhti Web Interface, which provides the same functionality directly. (Advanced)
